# Obsidian Vault Statistics (Mini)

This plugin is inspired by [Vault Statistics](https://github.com/bkyle/obsidian-vault-statistics-plugin).
It is a lighter and much faster version.

## Why a mini version?

[Vault Statistics](https://github.com/bkyle/obsidian-vault-statistics-plugin) parses all of your notes in order to calculate 
word count and link count. This obviously uses compute resources, and if you have a large vault, can take quite a bit of time.

This plugin only displays the following stats:

- Note Count
- Vault Size

Utilizing Obsidian API, this is done with only a few lines of code.
